# Sample contribution request for the topic "Input Validation in Node.js"

* Welcome to this repository! :slightly_smiling_face: Before explaining its content, we wanted to thank you for showing interest in collaborating with our secure code training academy [tablab.io][1].

## What are you going to find here?

* You will find the skeleton to create the sample of contribution content requested in our hiring process as Node.js Security Content Creator.
* Some parts are still incomplete, you will find more information about what's missing below.

## What is the structure of this repository?

* To answer this question, we recommend you to see the repository [sample-contribution-content][2], which represents a real contribution, and its `README.md` file explains the organization of files and directories.

## What should you do with this repository?

* Create a private fork of this repository. Share it only to the Github users [Ferran][3] and [Llu√≠s][4].
* Add content to your new private repository in order to finish this contribution on Input Validation.
* Once you consider that all content was added, **reply back to the email you received from us** so we can proceed to evaluate your fantastic work done. Afterwards, we will contact you.

## How should this contribution be finished/completed?

* There are mainly two sections that are still incomplete:
  * The `en/README.md` file. In this case, since the topic is "Input Validation in Node.js" this file should contain in-depth technical content about the following three points:
    * What is Input Validation?
    * What can be achieved with Input Validation as a security measure?
    * Explain the existing types of input validation. Please focus only on Normalizing Input to UTF-8, Syntax Validation, Regular Expression Validation, and Allow-List Validation.
  * You can find a simple Express web application in the `docker` folder that needs input validation to be secure. You should modify the code to implement an Input Validation strategy according to the needs of the application.
    * Make sure you don't implement another technique to query the database, such as prepared statements. Just add an input validation strategy in the current code.

## Should you respect any writing format?

* Yes, please refer to the repository [sample-contribution-content][2] where you will find an example and more information about this.
  * Basically, note the writing style by using bulleted lists with short, specific sentences. This is the writing format we want to use to explain content.

## Will you be financially compensated for this contribution?

* Sorry, this contribution will only be used to evaluate your skills, since it will be also implemented by a few other selected candidates.
* However, if we like your work, we will use this contribution to negotiate with you the financial reward from now on for future contributions (from $40 to $70, with potential for growth over time).
* Please note that in future contributions all code, as the simple Express web application in this case, will have to be implemented by yourself.

## Important considerations

* Nowadays, it is relatively easy to find information about Input Validation on Internet. The mission we have at [tablab.io][1] is not to provide just more information about this, but to provide the best content, and also including practical and training exercices. This involves:
  * Going in depth into the topic, with exhaustive analysis when it comes to explaining any concept.
  * Copyright of any information must be respected, sentences or text cannot be copied from other sites.
  * AI technologies can help you, but they may not give you exactly what we are looking for.
* The audience that will read the content and learn from it are other software developers, which allows you the use of technical words.
